Acoustic Scene Classification
=============================

The goal of acoustic scene classification is to classify a test recording into one of predefined classes that
characterizes the environment in which it was recorded â€” for example "outdoor market", "busy street", "office".

Classification performance is measured using accuracy: the number of correctly classified segments
among the total number of test segments.
